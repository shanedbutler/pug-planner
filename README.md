# Pick-Up Game Planner
Pick-Up Game Planner, also known as PUG Planner, or PUP is a web application to plan, organize and manage community pick-up game events. The application was designed specifically for soccer, but could easily be expanded to serve a wide variety of sports and activities, including tabletop and e-sports.

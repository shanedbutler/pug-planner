# Getting Started with PUG Planner

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and CSS has been built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## To run in development mode

In the front-end project directory, you can run:

### `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch`

The built CSS is not included in this repository. Run this command to start the the Tailwind CLI build process and watch your template files for Tailwind classes.\
The output css will be rebuilt when a change is made.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
